// ============================================================================
// Every "turn a failure into something a person can read" helper in the app.
//
// There are THREE, because they face three different failure sources and each
// produces different text. They used to live in three different packages, so
// call sites picked whichever they happened to find — ActivityDetailScreen
// imported two of them. They are gathered here to make the choice explicit.
// They are deliberately NOT merged: their outputs differ, so folding them
// together would change what the user sees.
//
//   friendlyFnError(t)    edge functions. Prefers the server's own JSON
//                         {"error": "..."} text, which is already written for
//                         a person (quota messages, "no key configured"),
//                         and otherwise maps transport noise to a hint.
//                         Takes a per-call-site [fallback].
//   friendlyAuthError(t)  Supabase GoTrue. Matches the terse auth strings
//                         ("Invalid login credentials") that no other source
//                         emits. Falls through to the raw message.
//   friendlyError(any)    generic/UI. Accepts Any? (a String banner OR a
//                         Throwable) and collapses anything long or unknown
//                         to a flat retry line.
//
// Callers still log the raw throwable via AppLog — this is only what the user
// reads.
