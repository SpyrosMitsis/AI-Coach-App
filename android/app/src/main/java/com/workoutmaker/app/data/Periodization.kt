// Client-side mirror of the periodization rules in supabase/functions/plan-week
// (search "PERIODIZATION" there — that block is the source of truth). It builds
// these same numbers into the planning prompt but never returns or stores them,
// so there is no ladder for the app to read back; projecting it here is the only
// way to show the athlete their own week-by-week loads. Keep the constants in
// step with plan-week. Precedent for a deliberate mirror like this:
// _shared/progression.ts mirrors StrengthProgression.kt.
//
// KNOWN DIVERGENCE from plan-week, on purpose: plan-week ramps off *last week's
// actual* TSS, so after a deload the next block restarts from the deload level
// and every cycle peaks ~18% lower than the last. That is almost certainly not
// the intent (the animated PeriodizationGraph shows each block peaking higher,
// which is what periodization means). This projection resumes the ramp from the
// last build peak. If plan-week is fixed, this needs no change.
