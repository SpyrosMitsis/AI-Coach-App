// Internal pseudo-navigation WITHIN the Strength tab — distinct from the real
// Nav Compose routes in MainActivity.kt (home/coach/calendar/strength/
// settings, plus push routes like history/exercise-stats). Use a StrengthNav
// case when the transition must keep this ViewModel's live in-memory state
// mounted underneath it (an active workout, its rest timer, the mid-session
// exercise picker) — none of that survives being torn down and recreated.
//
// Use a real NavHost route instead when the destination should behave like an
// actual screen: the system back button pops just it, it gets its own
// back-stack entry, and (per the exercise-stats routes in MainActivity.kt)
// share THIS SAME StrengthViewModel instance via hiltViewModel(parentEntry)
// rather than letting Nav Compose spin up a fresh one — that reference is the
// pattern to copy for any new entry point.
//
// Getting this wrong is exactly what caused the "exercise stats opens as a
// popup" bug: one entry point (the workout-detail stats button) was migrated
// to a real NavHost route, but the picker dialog and the in-session bottom
// sheet weren't, so they kept behaving like modals until all three were
// aligned. Every new "go look at X" affordance in this tab should make this
// choice deliberately, not by copying whichever pattern happened to be
// closest in the file.
