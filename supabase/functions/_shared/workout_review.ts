  // INTENSITY CEILING — a hard endurance session on a compromised athlete is

  // Final deterministic safety, even if the model (and the repair pass) ignored
  // the readiness signal. Runs before the TSS cross-check below so the recompute
  // reflects the downgraded zones.
  //
  // The caps are the SAME promises recoveryBlock (context.ts) makes to the
  // model, at the same band thresholds as recovery.ts (red <34, amber <67) —
  // ctx.readiness IS recovery.score in production. Amber used to be entirely
  // unchecked (formerly KNOWN_CONTRADICTIONS "recovery-cap"): the prompt
  // promised "amber → cap RPE 6, no intervals/threshold" and no code held it.
  // Deep TSB (≤ -20) keeps its own RPE 5 cap — that is the prompt's "recovery
  // week" rule, driven by load, not by today's recovery score. Endurance only:
  // strength intensity is governed by the progression snap above, and an amber
  // cap there would fight the engine's own targets.
  //
  // An UNMEASURED readiness caps nothing. With no wellness rows and no synced
  // signal the model lands on exactly 50/amber, which is the neutral midpoint,
  // not a reading — and it was silently clamping every hard session to RPE 6
  // for anyone without a wearable. The TSB cap below still applies: form is
  // computed from training the athlete actually did.
