// ============================================================================
// injury — the follow-up loop and the structural pain backoff.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. An injury used to be a fact captured once at onboarding
// and repeated into every prompt forever: "Knee (moderate)". Nothing asked
// whether it was still there, nothing recorded that a session hurt, and the
// only lever the coach had was more prose. Prose loses. The header comment on
// memoryDocsBlock (agent_memory.ts) spells out why: free text in
// coach_knowledge has NO date-level authority over a concrete prescription, and
// training_paused_until exists because a stated "I'm stopping until X" got
// scheduled over anyway. A backoff is the same class of fact, so it gets the
// same treatment: a structured, dated field that the engine enforces itself.
//
// Three pieces, all pure so they are trivially testable and shared by every
// consumer (daily-summary, generate-workout, plan-week, coach_tools, report-pain):
//
//   1. FOLLOW-UP    injuryFollowUpDue / markInjuryChecked
//                   "is this still bothering you?", a few days after it was
//                   raised, then weekly while it persists.
//   2. INVOLVEMENT  painCheckArea / exerciseLoadsArea / sportsToAvoid
//                   which injury a given session could plausibly have
//                   aggravated, so the pain question is asked about the right
//                   area and only when the session could have caused it.
//   3. BACKOFF      backoffFromPain / activeBackoffs / backoffBlock
//                   the escalation from a pain answer to a dated instruction,
//                   plus the readers the generators enforce it through.
//
// Dates are ISO YYYY-MM-DD and compared as strings, the way training_paused_until
// is. Every backoff is inclusive and SELF-EXPIRING: readers compare `until`
// against the client's local "today", so there is no cleanup job and no window
// where a stale row keeps suppressing training.
